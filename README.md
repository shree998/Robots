This is a simple React Application that generates a Robot image based on the name of the person, the names are generated via a Fake REST API, so it is pretty much static, in the future I will make this modifiable, so that you can enter any name and the app will generate a robot image accordingly. 
To use the app, follow the steps:
1) Fork it.
2) Clone this repo.
3) Install npm by typing npm install in the terminal.
4) run npm start.
